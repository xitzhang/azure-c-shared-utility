/*
A host is carried internally in its unbracketed form, with a raw "%" separating
an IPv6 address from an optional zone ID, for example "fe80::1%eth0". A URI or
HTTP authority needs the address bracketed, and RFC 6874 section 4 requires the
zone ID to be removed from anything sent to a peer because it only has meaning
on the sending host.

    "example.com"       -> "example.com"
    "192.0.2.1"         -> "192.0.2.1"
    "2001:db8::1"       -> "[2001:db8::1]"
    "fe80::1%eth0"      -> "[fe80::1]"

Used by uws_client.c for the WebSocket Host header, and by http_proxy_io.c for
the CONNECT request-target and its Host header.
